# Getting started

## How to Open An Issue

* Click the Issues tab at the top of the repository
* Look/Search through the list of open issues to see if an existing issue matches yours
 * If you find one that matches, or is close, please add your comments/suggestions/feedback to that issue
* If you don't see an existing issue that matches yours, please open a new issue using the green New Issue button.  Label your issue appropriately (the labes should be self explanatory)

## I want to contribute my own code, templates, scripts, whatever

* Create your own fork of the repository
* Make your changes in your fork
* Make sure your changes/additions include all the appropriate files 
* Submit a pull request and we will review it

## Would "X" be a good addition to the repository?

Open an issue describing X and we will consider it!

# Code review process

Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before itâ€™s accepted? When should you expect to hear from someone about your issue or pull request?

* The CCoE team looks at Pull Requests and issues on a daily basis. We will respond to all issues, comments and pull requests within our 24 hour SLA.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within one week. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
* A Bi-Weekly Summary of Changes to the repository is posted in the Slack CCoE_AWS and CCoE_Azure channels as well as sent via email distribution list.
